# Assigment1 (First console application for Advanced C# course)
The purpose of the assignment was to show the ease of array matrix implementation in C# as well as testing their implementation using static method calls. 
The program will take an input from the user for rows and coloumns (expected as Int value, exception handling was not added to this project). The program will initialize and print the designated array in row x column format. Next the printed sum & average of the matrix will be written to the console. Next printed to the console is two arrays for rows and coloumns each with a a value of the highest recorded double within the Nth row or coloumn.

Here is the array in proper format:
[ 61.18  99.81  33.62  22.74  41.86 ]
[ 12.83  81.12  60.61  86.69  89.15 ]
[ 30.7  91.69  40.45  53.69  50.11 ]
[ 34.89  82.18  62.03  46.89  64.98 ]
[ 18.74  74.5  30.3  39.06  90.49 ]


Here is the sum: 1400.31
Here is the average: 56.01

Here is the largest in each row:
[ 99.81  89.15  91.69  82.18  90.49 ]

Here is the largest in each column:
[ 61.18  99.81  62.03  86.69  90.49 ]
